# City Triangulation Quiz

Inspired by a game played in episode 1 of the 2020 season of [De Mol](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Mol_(TV_series)).

## What's in this repo

* `lib`: Some code to help produce data for different games (for now, this game just has 50 largest US cities (at least 50 miles apart), but I hope to add more games)
* `dist`: Game itself. Can run using [`http-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) or whatnot.
